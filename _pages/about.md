Hi! My name is Yik Siu, and I am a Computer Science master’s student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). My research interests lie in building safe, reliable, and interpretable AI, which I believe requires both rigorous evaluation of models’ external behavior and deeper understanding of their internal states. 

I have been fortunate to work with Dr. [Atticus Geiger](https://atticusg.github.io/), Prof. [Stephen Bach](https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach/) and Prof. [Ellie Pavlick](https://cs.brown.edu/people/epavlick/index.html) at Brown, Prof. [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://healthyml.org/) at MIT, and the [Personal Robots Group](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/personal-robots/overview/) at MIT Media Lab, where I began my research journey. I did my B.A. in Computer Science and Economics at Wellesley College, and I am very grateful to the Brown CS Department and the UWC Davis Scholarship for supporting my studies.

Note: **I'm applying for PhD positions for Fall 2026!** I would love to chat about research interests and opportunities. Please feel free to contact me at [yik_siu_chan@brown.edu](yik_siu_chan@brown.edu).
